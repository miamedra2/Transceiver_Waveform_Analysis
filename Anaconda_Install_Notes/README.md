This folder contains instructions on how to install all the adi python modules.  These modules
are necessary in order to get all the adi stuff working.  Directions are in the "anaconda" section
in Anaconda_install_notes.pdf.

Also, this contains base_env.yml -  which is a backup of my Anaconda environment.
