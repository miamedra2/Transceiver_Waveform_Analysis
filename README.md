# Waveform_Analysis

The modules here are: 

ADRV9009_chirp_Generation.py - used to generate chirps from the ADRV9009 DAC
ADRV9009_SquareWave_Generation.py - used to generate SquareWaves from the ADRV9009 DAC
Transceiver_ADRV9009_DataCollection.py - used to generate chirps from the Transceiver design and collect 
					 using the ADRV9009 ADC
Transceiver_SquareWave_Generation.py -  used to generate Squarewaves from the Transceiver.

The rest of the .ipynb notebooks:

How_To_Init_zcu102.ipynb - walks you through the power cycle process and initializing the reference clocks.
How_To_ADRV9009_Chirps_DataCollection.ipynb - shows how to generate a chirp/collect data with ADRV9009 DAC/ADC.
How_To_ADRV9009_Sine_DataCollection.ipynb - shows how to generate a squarewave/collect data with ADRV9009 DAC/ADC.
How_To_Transceiver_Chirps_DataCollection.ipynb - shows how to generate chirps/collect data with Transceiver/ADRV9009 ADC.
How_To_Transeiver_Squarewave_DataCollection.ipynb - shows how to generate Squarewaves/collect data with Transceiver/ADRV9009 ADC.
